# Bug-Reports 

Hello! My name is Anna Panova. There are my bug reports in these folders. I wrote 50 bug reports in Mantis on different types of testing: Web UI and Functional testing, Mobile and Game testing.
I tested http://opencart.qatestlab.net/ website for Web UI and Functional testing. The "Photo Background Changer" app was tested for Mobile testing by me too. As for Game testing, I tested the “Pubg Mobile” game in iOS and the “Grand Theft Auto: Vice City” game in Windows 10.
And also I was beta testing a real site: https://openlibrary.org/.
